                            <p>Physics is an experimental and theoretical science. It lies in the balance of theory being confirmed by experiment while experiment may drave theory. 
                                    The realm of theoretical physics is concerned with finding mathematical theories that describe our world in ways we will (hopefully) assert via experimentation.</p>
                            <p>Mathematical physics is a broad subject. I like to think of it as dual to theoretical physics in that a mathematical physicist expands the mathematics found in the theoretical models that physicist create. 
                                    A mathematician is concerned with the rigor of the mathematics being correct, whereas a physicist cares about the model working properly.
                                    Hence, there is indeed a gap that must be filled in order for the mathematics to be well-posed.</p>

                            <p>The world around us is a complex dyamical beast. One such way of capturing the behavior of model systems is through PDEs. A motivating example is the model of heat flow on a piece of ice where heat is being pumped into the ice through its boundary. Even such a simple system can become complex. Yet, in order to be able to solve such models, we make simplifying assumptions (the cube is homogeneous in specific heat, it cannot melt, and it is nicely shaped). When we remove such restrictions, we find ourselves in the realm of numerical PDEs and computing.</p>
                            <p>PDEs are also highly geometrical as one finds the relationships causing dynamics to be intimately connected to the structure of the domain of interest. In the previous example, we can imagine the crystaline structure of ice allows one to understand the routes that energy must flow, and it is through this geometric information that we are capturing change.</p>

                            <p>Linear Programming is the technique of portraying complicated relationships between elements by using linear functions to find optimum points. The relationships may be more complicated than accounted for, however linear programming allows for a simplified understanding of their connections.</p>
                            <p>Linear programming is often used when seeking the optimal solution to a problem, given a set of constraints. To find the optimum result, real-life problems are translated into mathematical models to better conceptualize linear inequalities and their constraints.</p>
